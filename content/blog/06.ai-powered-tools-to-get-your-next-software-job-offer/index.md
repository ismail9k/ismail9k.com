## Create a Resume

If you are using Microsoft Word for creating your resume, I can't judge you (I used to use HTML and CSS for mine), but come on... there are hundreds of tools online to finish this task for you already with great results, and here is some:

### [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/)

If you already have a LinkedIn portfolio (which you should have Mr. 🤓), you can extract your data into a resume file. To access the resume builder:

* Click the __Me__ icon at the top of your LinkedIn homepage.
* Click __View profile__.
* Click the __More…__ button in the introduction card.
* Select __Build a resume__ from the dropdown.
* Edit the content then save it as a pdf

### [Canva](http://bit.ly/canva-resume-maker)

If you’d like to have a more vivid resume with more design details, Canva will perfectly suit your needs. With a variety of pre-made resume designs that you can pick from.

### [Zety](https://www.zety.com)

Zety is a great website if you're focusing only on the resume details and don't like to get involved with the design headache.

The best thing about Zety is that it has a wizard that takes you through several steps to generate your resume, and each step gives you suggestions and tips which are extremely helpful. Another great thing I really liked; you can fill the data with your current resume or start from scratch.

Unfortunately, they don't have a free option to download your resume 😢. But, I think __$2.70__ is a good deal compared to the service you will get.

### [Resume Lab](https://resumelab.com/)

Resume Lab is another great platform that focuses on create Resumes, CVs, and covers letters. They also have A fully complementary blog with over 250+ custom-tailored career guides and white-paper studies.

Their system has a unique feature, which compares your resume's strength to other resumes in real-time.

## Audit Your Resume

The fastest way to improve your chances of being accepted on the job is to have artificial intelligence on your side.

### [Grammarly](https://grammarly.com/)

Grammarly without saying is your superhero; it can save you from embarrassing situations, such as sending your profile with a typo or a grammatical error. You can use it to audit your resume writing tone and grammar.

Their monthly subscription costs A LOT, but for one who is not working as a copywriter, the free plan is more than enough.

### [Resume Worded](https://bit.ly/ResumeWorded)

Resume Worded is an AI-powered platform that provides you with detailed feedback on your resume and LinkedIn profile. It gives you some free hints to improve it, and they promise you that finding your dream job is certain and they may be right.

I gave it a try myself; I thought that my resume should get high results, but out of 100, I got only 61. I have a lot of things to improve here.

It tested my resume data in four domains: __impact__, __brevity__, __style__, and __skills__ and it gave specific details on points of strength and weakness, and how you can improve it.
